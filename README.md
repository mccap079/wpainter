---

Wendypaint.com clone as a windows and macos native app. Not including a few features. Credit for the underlying concept goes to Kim Asendorf, creator of the now defunct wendypaint.com, who has nothing to do with this project otherwise. This has been built from scratch (using openframeworks) to match the original functionality.

I was an avid wendypaint.com participant, and particularly appreciated its embrace of the pixel in its visual style instead of attempting to antialias and skeuomorph the harsh grid of the lcd screen out of sight. So I enjoyed being able to effortlessly create my own paintings in this sandbox that captured this sensibility in a compelling way. Like every creators platform its time has come to die, bringing all of its users' uploaded content along with it, so I figured I'd just rebuild it so I (and maybe anyone else) can continue making cutesy little pixellated paintings forevermore.

Todo
:
 - Change canvas size
