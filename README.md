---

Wendypaint.com clone as a windows and macos native app. Not including a few features. Credit for the underlying concept goes to Kim Asendorf, creator of wendypaint.com, who has nothing to do with this project otherwise. This has been built from scratch (using openframeworks) to match the original functionality.

Todo
:
 - Change canvas size
 - Better painting loader
 - Autofill functions for brush canvas
 - Bleed fx
